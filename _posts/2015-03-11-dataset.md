## Dataset with age label
1. Abalone Data Set
    + **Abstract**: Predict the age of abalone from physical measurements.
    + 4177 instances, 8 attributes
    + **From** [https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Abalone](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Abalone)
2. Contraceptive Method Choice Data Set
    + **Abstract**: This dataset is a subset of the 1987 National Indonesia Contraceptive Prevalence Survey. The samples are married women who were either not pregnant or do not know if they were at the time of interview. The problem is to predict the current contraceptive method choice (no use, long-term methods, or short-term methods) of a woman based on her demographic and socio-economic characteristics.
    + 1473 instances, 9 attributes

3. Statlog (German Credit Data) Data Set 
    + **Abstract**: This dataset classifies people described by a set of attributes as good or bad credit risks. Comes in two formats (one all numeric). Also comes with a cost matrix.
    + 1000 instances, 20 attributes
    + **From** [https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Statlog+(German+Credit+Data)](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Statlog+(German+Credit+Data))

## Dataset with ordered label
1. Australian Sign Language signs (High Quality) Data Set 
    + **Abstract**: This data consists of sample of Auslan (Australian Sign Language) signs. 27 examples of each of 95 Auslan signs were captured from a native signer using high-quality position trackers.
    + 2565 instances, 22 attributes
    + **From** [https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Australian+Sign+Language+signs+%28High+Quality%29](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Australian+Sign+Language+signs+%28High+Quality%29)
2. Optical Recognition of Handwritten Digits Data Set 
    + **Abstract**: We used preprocessing programs made available by NIST to extract normalized bitmaps of handwritten digits from a preprinted form. From a total of 43 people, 30 contributed to the training set and different 13 to the test set. 32x32 bitmaps are divided into nonoverlapping blocks of 4x4 and the number of on pixels are counted in each block. This generates an input matrix of 8x8 where each element is an integer in the range 0..16. This reduces dimensionality and gives invariance to small distortions.
    + 5620 instances, 64 attributes
